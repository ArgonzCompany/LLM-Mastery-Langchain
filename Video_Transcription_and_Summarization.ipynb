              "'Imagine que…\\nO ano é 1905. Certo dia, o\\xa0\\xa0 relógio da torre de Berna, na Suíça, está um pouco\\xa0\\natrasado. Dois minutos, para sermos mais precisos.\\xa0 Por causa disso, um homem que vive perto\\xa0\\nna torre não acorda na mesma hora em que\\xa0\\xa0 costuma acordar todos os dias para ir trabalhar.\\nAo perceber a confusão, ele fica um pouco nervoso.\\xa0 Demora mais para se vestir,\\xa0\\ntomar café e sair de casa.\\xa0 Acaba saindo cinco minutos depois do\\xa0\\nhabitual. E começa a cruzar a rua.\\xa0 Enquanto isso, um banqueiro estreia\\xa0\\nseu novo automóvel sem saber que tem\\xa0\\xa0 um pequeno problema nos freios.\\nDirigindo em alta velocidade,\\xa0\\xa0 ele mal consegue desviar de uma carruagem.\\nNosso homem, cruzando a rua distraído,\\xa0\\xa0 não vê o carro chegar.\\nEle é atropelado e morre.\\xa0 Mas este homem era nada mais nada\\xa0\\nmenos do que Albert Einstein.\\xa0 Naquele ano, Einstein teria\\xa0\\npublicado quatro trabalhos\\xa0\\xa0 que se tornariam a base da física moderna.\\nMas agora, inovações como o GPS, as telas\\xa0\\xa0 de TV e os semicondutores que nos permitiram\\xa0\\ncriar os computadores portáteis nunca ocorrem.\\xa0 O computador, o laptop ou o celular em que você\\xa0\\xa0 está assistindo esse vídeo nunca chegam a\\xa0\\nexistir. E este vídeo… também não existe.\\xa0 Esta sequência de eventos é um exemplo\\xa0\\ndo que se conhece como efeito borboleta,\\xa0\\xa0 uma manifestação da Teoria do Caos.\\nDurante muitos séculos, o mundo\\xa0\\xa0 foi explicado através das leis de\\xa0\\nIsaac Newton e da física clássica.\\xa0 De acordo com estas leis, se conhecemos o estado\\xa0\\natual de um objeto, podemos prever com relativa\\xa0\\xa0 facilidade seu comportamento no futuro.\\nA Teoria do Caos questiona essa visão\\xa0\\xa0 determinista: nem tudo é previsível,\\xa0\\nnem funciona como um relógio.\\xa0 Desde os anos 1800, matemáticos propunham\\xa0\\na ideia de que nem todos os fenômenos\\xa0\\xa0 podiam ser previstos pelas leis newtonianas.\\nMas foi um meteorologista chamado Edward Lorenz\\xa0\\xa0 que fez da teoria do caos um fenômeno visível.\\nTudo começou em 1961, quando ele trabalhava em um\\xa0\\xa0 modelo matemático para prever o estado do tempo.\\nLorenz estava colocando em seu computador dados\\xa0\\xa0 como temperatura, umidade, pressão\\xa0\\natmosférica e direção do vento.\\xa0 E o computador desenhava um gráfico modelando como\\xa0\\nseria o comportamento do tempo - ele não acertava\\xa0\\xa0 sempre, mas se aproximava bastante da realidade.\\nEm uma manhã, Lorenz decidiu verificar\\xa0\\xa0 alguns resultados. Pausou o modelo no\\xa0\\ncomputador e, para economizar tempo,\\xa0\\xa0 fez os cálculos ele mesmo. Ligou de novo o\\xa0\\nmodo automático e saiu para tomar um café.\\xa0 Quando ele voltou, o gráfico resultado era muito\\xa0\\ndiferente do original.

              "\"Imagine that…\\nThe year is 1905. One day, the clock in the tower of Bern, Switzerland, is a little\\nslow.  Two minutes, to be precise. Because of this, a man who lives near\\nthe tower does not wake up at the same time he usually does every day to go to work.\\nWhen he realizes the confusion, he gets a little nervous.  It takes longer to get dressed,\\nhave coffee and leave the house.  It ends up leaving five minutes later than\\nusual.  And he starts to cross the street. Meanwhile, a banker debuts\\nhis new car without knowing that it has a small problem with the brakes.\\nDriving at high speed, he barely manages to avoid a carriage.\\nOur man, crossing the street distracted, doesn't see the car arriving.\\nHe gets run over and dies. But this man was none\\nother than Albert Einstein. That year, Einstein would have\\npublished four works that would become the basis of modern physics.\\nBut now, innovations like GPS, TV screens, and the semiconductors that allowed us to\\ncreate portable computers never happen. The computer, laptop or cell phone you are watching this video on never\\nexists.  And this video… doesn’t exist either. This sequence of events is an example\\nof what is known as the butterfly effect, a manifestation of Chaos Theory.\\nFor many centuries, the world was explained through the laws of\\nIsaac Newton and classical physics. According to these laws, if we know the\\ncurrent state of an object, we can relatively easily predict its behavior in the future.\\nChaos Theory questions this deterministic view: not everything is predictable,\\nnor does it work like clockwork. Since the 1800s, mathematicians have proposed\\nthe idea that not all phenomena could be predicted by Newtonian laws.\\nBut it was a meteorologist named Edward Lorenz who made chaos theory a visible phenomenon.  It\\nall started in 1961, when he was working on a mathematical model to predict the weather.\\nLorenz was entering data such as temperature, humidity,\\natmospheric pressure and wind direction into his computer. And the computer drew a graph modeling how\\nthe weather would behave - it didn't always get it right , but it came pretty close to reality.\\nOne morning, Lorenz decided to check some results.  He paused the model on the\\ncomputer and, to save time, did the calculations himself.  He turned on\\nautomatic mode again and went out for a coffee. When he came back, the resulting graph was very\\ndifferent from the original.  It started out very similar, but halfway through, it had a\\nvery divergent trajectory. Surprised, he revised the numbers.  And he realized\\nthat the number he had entered by hand had three decimal places less than what\\nthe computer was using before. This difference, which changed\\nthe graph's trajectory so much, is equivalent to a speck of dust on the Eiffel Tower,\\nor one less feather in the weight of a duck. Lorenz deduced that this experiment was not\\na special case - that there were systems in which minute differences produced,\\nover time, monumental changes, making their future unpredictable.\\nThis means that the flapping of a butterfly's wings in Brazil could, in theory, produce\\nenough disturbance, a certain “chaos”, to end up causing a hurricane in Texas.\\nIn other words, no matter how much we know the laws of nature, there are no measurements that\\ngive us perfect data and allow us to determine the position and speed of\\neach atom in the universe at every moment. And this “lack of accuracy” in our calculations\\nmakes any predictions difficult – and, in fact, makes it impossible to predict anything in the long term.\\nBut chaos is not the same as lack of order. Even though chaos makes predictions difficult,\\nthe universe we live in is not random and continues to obey natural laws.\\nFurthermore, no matter how chaotic it may seem, a system always follows a\\ntrajectory to certain points. Lorenz proved this when he realized that, in the\\ncalculations he used in his model, the repeated trajectory to the same points created a pattern that\\nlooked exactly like the wings of a butterfly. Understanding patterns within chaos\\nhas many practical applications. On the Stock Exchange, it shows us that\\na slight fluctuation can cause a crisis in the market – and that is why we cannot\\ntalk about predictions, only probabilities. In the case of the human body, it helps us\\nunderstand the behavior of a heart with cardiac arrhythmia.\\nAnd even in human behavior, the butterfly effect helps us analyze\\nsocial phenomena – for example, how trolling on social media can be\\ntriggered by just one negative comment. Our universe continues to obey the\\nlaws of cause and effect.  The sun will continue to rise every morning.  The planes we\\nbuild will continue to fly. Ultimately, chaos theory introduces an element of uncertainty into\\nour reading of the Universe. And it calls into question the limits\\nof our knowledge. We will continue to follow the\\nmost important events in Brazil and the world on our website, bbcbrasil.com Thank you for listening, bye bye\""
